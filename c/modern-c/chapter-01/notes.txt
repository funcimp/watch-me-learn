I got this to run with:

clang -flto -std=c99 -O3 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror main.c

which outputs a.out.


Thoughts: While this seems familiar as someone who writes plenty of go, this syntax seems a bit alien
```
double A[5]
```
It seems like I'm declaring a variable name A which is an array of length 5 with items that are type double,
but I'm not quite sure why you aren't declaring something like `[]double` like you would in go. My guess is that
if you declare a `[5]` this implies that you are making A as an array of length 5 in which the contents of the array
are type `double`
